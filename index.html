        </h3>Post <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/188611">188611</a> deleted: <br /> This post was deleted for the following reason: &quot;The Dems are enabling Trump&apos;s slide to fascism by not fighting hard enough&quot; is a thesis we&apos;ve covered in extreme length and depth on every angle in the last several years. There is no shortage of this kind of comparison; we&apos;ve got multiple other posts arguing around the details of the <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/188460/We-Dont-Know-How-to-Warn-You-Any-Harder-America-is-Dying">slide to fascism</a> and how people of prominence should be fighting back just in the last week. But staking the whole post around just this comparison invites really really pointless fights over whether the exact historical comparison holds up, making for superheated fighting (superheated as if one side were somehow in favor of Nazis) among people who all agree Trump&apos;s a fascist monster and everything should be done to stop him. It&apos;s a bad dynamic to set up, let&apos;s not. -- <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/36820" id="sig">LobsterMitten</a>
