Post <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/207228">207228</a> deleted: <br /> This post was deleted for the following reason: Remember that MetaFilter is not a news site. We&apos;re a community weblog where people post interesting links. If you believe that a news or political link needs or has to be on MetaFilter, please reconsider that thought carefully. But if you&apos;re sure about it, please take a little time to frame the link(s) in an interesting way. Single link posts are ok, but they really need a couple sentences to give context. -- <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/303778" id="sig">loup</a>
