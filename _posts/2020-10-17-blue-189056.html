Post <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/189056">189056</a> deleted: <br /> This post was deleted for the following reason: Upon further examination, this is feeling less like &quot;enjoy a fun eccentric history nerd from the old internet&quot; and more like ... what it expressly says, a wish for a violent overthrow of democracy with bonus side helping of white nationalism and colonialism was good... and that&apos;s not feeling like something we need to be throwing eyes to. -- <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/36820" id="sig">LobsterMitten</a>
