Post <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/194429">194429</a> deleted: <br /> This post was deleted for the following reason: this might be better as a part of a wider post/conversation on beauty standards or perhaps beauty standards and mental health, but as is, there are so many assertions here that seem questionable that as a stand-alone piece it&apos;s unfortunately more likely to spark arguments than thoughtful examination of multiple issues (and a lot of arguing back and forth about &quot;are these women ugly?,&quot; for example, would not be a great discussion to have) -- <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/14421" id="sig">taz</a>
