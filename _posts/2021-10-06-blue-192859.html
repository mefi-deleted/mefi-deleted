Post <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/192859">192859</a> deleted: <br /> This post was deleted for the following reason: Eesh, the &quot;Black music but it&apos;s white people&quot; thing is pretty fraught at best and the weird anti-Asian shit in latter part of that flash animation video is outright awful.  I feel you on the fun goofy music instinct but this ain&apos;t it. -- <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/7418" id="sig">cortex</a>
