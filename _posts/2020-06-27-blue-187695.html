Post <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/187695">187695</a> deleted: <br /> This post was deleted for the following reason: This comic (the caveman-language and other caveman tropes, kidnapping a woman who fights back and then is miserable bearing children) is going to land very differently for Mefites today than it would have in 1975. Maybe better to post it with more context or in some way that doesn&apos;t just rely on readers taking it as if they had 1975 sensibilities? -- <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/36820" id="sig">LobsterMitten</a>
