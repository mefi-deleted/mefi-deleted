Post <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/199094">199094</a> deleted: <br /> This post was deleted for the following reason: Post removed due to framing. People found it dispiriting and spreading hopelessness, while also &quot;punching down&quot; on a minor.

Reframing this around the son attempting to talk to his father the governor might go better. -- <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/17675" id="sig">Brandon Blatcher</a>
