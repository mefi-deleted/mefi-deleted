Post <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/206440">206440</a> deleted: <br /> This post was deleted for the following reason: Sorry, but this conflicts with some criteria for <a href="https://theactionalliance.org/sites/default/files/recommendations-for-reporting-suicide.pdf">Best Practices and Recommendations for Reporting on Suicide</a>, which we try to abide by. No problem to do an edit and re-up for this. -- <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/14421" id="sig">taz</a>
