Post <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193267">193267</a> deleted: <br /> This post was deleted for the following reason: The info about the two stories winning Pulitzers isn&apos;t accurate (it looks like one 2017 article did, among 20, but the 2019 one def did not win 2018 Pulitzer), and this bit seems sort of added on as a &quot;gotcha&quot; type thing. A post about this is fine, but let&apos;s not start off with misinfo messiness to get everyone riled. -- <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/14421" id="sig">taz</a>
