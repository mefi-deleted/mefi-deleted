Post <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/187674">187674</a> deleted: <br /> This post was deleted for the following reason: I know Scalzi&apos;s a MeFi local but I don&apos;t feel like this blog post or him personally makes a lot of sense as the thing to center further discussion about this on; he&apos;s got a comment section on that post which seems like a good place to engage with his writing specifically, and if there&apos;s a post to be made about some of the folks whose behavior he&apos;s discussing as fuckups beyond the existing <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/187414/Cards-Against-Humanity-is-Over">Temkin</a> and <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/187562/Warren-Ellis-Accused-of-Grooming-Young-Women-for-Decades">Ellis</a> threads it should probably be framed more around those folks directly. -- <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/7418" id="sig">cortex</a>
