Post <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/192308">192308</a> deleted: <br /> This post was deleted for the following reason: There isn&apos;t really anything in this article that we haven&apos;t discussed at length, and it uses weasel words to hide Greenwald&apos;s legitimate problems; &quot;pro bono work as a civil liberties defender&quot; is doing a lot of work to smooth over the fact that he defended a violent white supremacist, called the minority victims &quot;disgusting,&quot; and almost got disbarred for his courtroom misconduct. -- <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/102200" id="sig">Eyebrows McGee</a>
