Post <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/187930">187930</a> deleted: <br /> This post was deleted for the following reason: While the general topic of anonymity online is a subject we can productively address, an essay valorizing a site known for (among other things) using the humanity of transgender people as an abstract topic for debate is definitely not going to work here. -- <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/14421" id="sig">taz</a>
