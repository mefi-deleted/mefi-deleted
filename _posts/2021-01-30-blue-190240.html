Post <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/190240">190240</a> deleted: <br /> This post was deleted for the following reason: This is sort of an odd post to make a year after the fact and on the other side of Trump&apos;s administration. The story an issue could be fine to post about but I think framing and sources that don&apos;t have that double-take feeling of talking about the past admin in the present tense would help there. -- <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/7418" id="sig">cortex</a>
