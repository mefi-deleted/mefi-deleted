Post <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/187789">187789</a> deleted: <br /> This post was deleted for the following reason: The Thai coconut industry, and the role of macaques and changes in that over time, seems like an interesting subject for a post, but per some of the comments below I think that post could have more depth and currency in its sources and more care in the phrasing used.  Maybe give this another go tomorrow? -- <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/7418" id="sig">cortex</a>
