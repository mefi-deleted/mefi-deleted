Post <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/189999">189999</a> deleted: <br /> This post was deleted for the following reason: The timeline in the post seems misleading enough to be a problem for discussion (the tweet is from Dec 2019, it&apos;s not a response to the trump ban); maybe find more recent news on this if it still is a going concern? -- <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/36820" id="sig">LobsterMitten</a>
