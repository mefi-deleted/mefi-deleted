Post <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/192069">192069</a> deleted: <br /> This post was deleted for the following reason: I&apos;m not sure that Metafilter is the ideal audience for a &quot;you need to spiral into utter hopeless despair more than you are already spiralling ... no, more than that!&quot; pep talk. We kind of already have that aspect covered?  (and as <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/188460/We-Dont-Know-How-to-Warn-You-Any-Harder-America-is-Dying#7974793">more</a> than <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/188460/We-Dont-Know-How-to-Warn-You-Any-Harder-America-is-Dying#7974796">one</a> mefite has noted of the author, &quot;... Umair Haique ... makes me want to give up.&quot;) There is actually a still-open thread discussing  <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/191942/All-the-right-words-on-climate-have-already-been-said">required awareness quotient</a> around catastrophic climate change, so maybe there is good post potential in a more &quot;what people can actually do&quot; sort of approach? Please contact us if you&apos;d like to discuss! -- <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/14421" id="sig">taz</a>
