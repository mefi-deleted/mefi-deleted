Post <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/188724">188724</a> deleted: <br /> This post was deleted for the following reason: Hey this is framed in a kind of conspiratorial way that makes it feel like misinformation and we&apos;re trying to be careful around coronavirus related info. There are clinical trials related to <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=coronavirus&amp;term=vitamin+d&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist=">vitamin D</a>; maybe there&apos;s a better way to collect reliable info on where things stand on vitamin D? -- <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/36820" id="sig">LobsterMitten</a>
