Post <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/193477">193477</a> deleted: <br /> This post was deleted for the following reason: This has been flagged a lot, and I&apos;m going to go ahead and delete and say that we can possibly have a post on this, and there are some compelling aspects that can be reasonably discussed -- and, unfortunately, a lot of takes that will reliably lead to a hateful garbage fire of a thread, so it&apos;s going to need careful framing and a willingness among participants to navigate such an emotional and awful story thoughtfully for a non-awful discussion. (For an awful discussion, there are already many easily available around the internet.) -- <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/14421" id="sig">taz</a>
