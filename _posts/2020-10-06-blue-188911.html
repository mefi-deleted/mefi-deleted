Post <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/188911">188911</a> deleted: <br /> This post was deleted for the following reason: So ... not really seeing what makes this worth a post? This author / instructor person basically did what she said she would in the large print, apparently? And one lesser known media source seems to be reporting the misdemeanor charge? (can&apos;t read it from where I am.) If there&apos;s something that makes this more significant than it appears, please contact us! Thanks. -- <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/14421" id="sig">taz</a>
